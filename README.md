# Deep-Learning-Portfolio-Project

This is a my solution for the final portfolio project for the Codecademy course ["Build Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow). The goal with this project is to perform basic data exploration and then build a deep learning model that can be used for cover type classification or forests. This will be done based on a given dataset that contains different cartographic varaibles.
